# infinite_numbers

Do you find 64 bits limiting ? Ever wished to go towards infinity ? Yeah me too, that's why I'm making truly infinite numbers.

## Integral numbers

I have curently only made infinite integral numbers, but I plan on expanding it to floating point ones in the future.

### how does it work ?

the infinite int is made by combining a linked list, containing the actual values, and a boolean variable to determine if it's a positive or a negative number.

### curently supported operations

- << : you can use it to display your numbers, obviously
- every comparator : it would indeed be useful to be able to compare numbers
- basic operations : add, substract, and multiply
- unary negation

### planned operations

- / : division, but not by zero ;)
- % : Remainder
- ++ and --
- basic operations, but with = (+=, -=, *=, /=, %=)

## how to use in your projects

for now you can only take the infInt cpp and hpp files and drop them in your project, but I plan on making it a library (or the c++ equivalent to that)

## wanna help me ?

If you want to help, you can either find problems and open an issue, or do some programming then open a pull request
